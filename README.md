# Introduction to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

an API is a set of protocols and routines for building and interacting with software applications. 
Another way to think of it is that an API is a bunch of code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. 
For example:
 * if you wanted to stream twitter data by writing some Python code, you would use the Twitter API.
 * If you wanted to automate pulling and processing information
